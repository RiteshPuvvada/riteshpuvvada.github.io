      <description>Hello, I’m Ritesh
A tech geek mainly focused on networks, which got my special attention towards it. On my way to explore all that networking is made for, My journey started with the curiosity about the wonders of cybersecurity.
And is going on currently playing CTF’s all the time. Initially, I was a noob fascinated by the various hacking techniques gained while hacking them ethically and now I can say I am on the way to hack all these skills ethically into myself !</description>
