      <description>Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is an exploit in which the attacker can take advantage of an insecure template engine to inject a malicious payload into a template, which is then executed server-side.
What is a template engine? A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client.</description>

      <description>What is SQL injection? SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application&amp;rsquo;s content or behavior.</description>
